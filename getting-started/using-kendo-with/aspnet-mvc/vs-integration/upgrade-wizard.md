#Upgrade Wizard

This help topic shows how to upgrade a Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Application.

The Upgrade Wizard has two main purposes:

- Check and retrieve the latest available Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC  release
- Change the version of Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC in the projects in the solution use.

The Upgrade Wizard can be launched from **Visual Studio | Telerik | Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC | Upgrade Wizard**

##Choose which projects will be updated

The page allows you to configure the following options:

- **Version** - Select from all versions that have been previously installed or downloaded using the VS Extensions
- **Add referenced assemblies to solution** - Choose whether to copy referenced assemblies to your solution folder. The assemblies will automatically get added to source control when using Microsoft Team Foundation Server
- **Download** – Launch the Latest Version Acquirer tool
- **Browse** - Browse to a location where the new version is manually downloaded and extracted
- **Choose Projects** - Choose which projects will be updated (it is recommended to keep all Telerik projects the same version)

> **Note:**
The distribution, downloaded by the Upgrade Wizard contains only the "hotfix" files, e.g. the bare bone files, needed for a project to run correctly. It does not contain the documentation or the demo project.

> **Note:**
The listed projects use Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC** 4. If the solution contains any projects which use **Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC for other MVC version, they will be displayed on a separate page. When you complete the wizard all selected projects from the different pages will be updated.
