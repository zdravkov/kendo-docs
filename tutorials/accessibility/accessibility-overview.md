# Kendo UI Accessibility Overview

## An Introduction to Accessibility

Web Accessibility, simply put, is the creation of sites and applications that can be fully experienced by the broadest number of users. That includes disabled users, who typically visit the sites we create with the help of assistive technologies, like a screen reader.

For the most basic, text-driven web experiences, these technologies work well, and disabled users benefit greatly. But the web has exploded well beyond the realm of text-based experiences in the last decade, and assistive technologies have struggled to keep up.

The good news is that there is something that we can do as web developers to easily bridge the gap to those assistive technologies, which enables these tools to better aid disabled users as they interact with the sites we create. By providing things like full keyboard support, high-contrast visual elements, text-based equivalents of non-text elements and by adhering to standards like [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/), [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov), we have the tools we need, as developers, to create accessible, rich Internet applications.

## Accessibility, Standards and Kendo UI

Starting with the Q3 2012 Release of Kendo UI, we're striving to not only embrace popular accessibility standards and guidelines, but to do as much as possible to bake support for these standards into Kendo UI Web and make them available to you right out of the box.

In the Summer of 2012, we performed an exhaustive review of the WC3's [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) and [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) specifications, as well as the US Federal Government's [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov) guidelines. Our goal was to determine which accessibility features were most important to provide and, for our Q3 release, we decided to focus on the following Accessibility improvements:

- [WAI-ARIA Support for Kendo UI Web](/kendo-ui/tutorials/accessibility/wai-aria-support-in-kendo)
- [Full Keyboard Support for Kendo UI Web](/kendo-ui/tutorials/accessibility/keyboard-support)
- [A WCAG 2.0 AAA Compliant High-Contrast Theme](/kendo-ui/tutorials/accessibility/high-contrast-theme)
- [RTL Support for right-to-left languages](/kendo-ui/tutorials/accessibility/supporting-rtl-languages)

We believe that these improvements make Kendo UI Web an industry leader in terms of accessibility support, but this is just the beginning. Our long-term goal is to provide full WAI-ARI support as well as WCAG and Section 508 compliance for all of Kendo UI, and we'll be pursuing that goal in future releases.
