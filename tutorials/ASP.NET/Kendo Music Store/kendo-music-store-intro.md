# Tutorial: Kendo Music Store: Introduction

In this tutorial, we will review portions of the **Kendo Music Store** sample project,
focusing on how Kendo UI was used, and the ways in which it interacts with ASP.NET MVC
and WebAPI.

This sample project was based on Microsoft's **[MVC Music Store][1]**, so much of the
server-side processing and the data structure are reused in this project. The UI of the
music store was completely redesigned with Kendo UI.

## Get the Source Code

Start by getting the source code for the [Kendo Music Store from GitHub][2].
The project is for use with Microsoft VisualStudio 2012, and requires MVC 4 and NuGet.
